# Portfolio-Projects

Hi! my name is Eric Terlop and here is a list of all the projects I have so far on so far that I felt was worth uploading. I am always coding in my free time and trying to learn new things.

### C# Console Projects
The goal for these projects was to show off some of the C# I have learned so far. These are only console applications but they do showcase the use of multiple class files and objects. My most recent C# project is the War game.

### RPG Adventure Game*
The goal for this game was to showcase some of the JavaScript skills I know and how I can use it to manipulate the elements on the page as well as using CSS to offset the need for so much JavaScript. I am using a timer to keep track of time for each problem. Using JavaScript to generate random problems to the user and generate an array of random answers, shuffling the array to present true random answers to the user. This game is far from finished and is a work in progress passion project I am working on.

### Tip Calculator
The goal for this project was to use some simple logic using javascript to make a tip calculator. I also used JavaScript to validate user input.

### Whack a Mole
The goal for this project was to use Javascript to set a timer for the mole buttons and have event listeners for the buttons when they pressed. This was a very early Javascript project I worked on, one of my first projects.
